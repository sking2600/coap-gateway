I'm just trying to keep a running list of edge casess that need to be confirmed/accounted for before this app is production ready:


provided tokens are invalid (should I differentiate between expired and incorrect?)
coap server times out or is otherwise unavailable
redis has incorrect pod IP for that specific device
    device-side failure: how do I detect that? surely there needs to be some configurability for this
how to handle ungraceful shutdown of coap server    
    need to clear out stale entries in redis (this has implications on db design)
    do I need a daemon set to come in after the fact for graceful shutdown? what about for node failures?
malformed request payload

how to handle load balancing for coap server?
    how does coap server know when to shed load
        how to determine which load to shed? truly random, weighted random based on age of connection? strictly based on age of connection?
    how does coap server know when to start ignoring readiness checks?
        LIFO queue?
    what SLI's are most important?
